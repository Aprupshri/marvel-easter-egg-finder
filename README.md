### **Marvel Easter Eggs Finder**

#### A smart web application built with Next.js that uses the Gemini AI to find, explain, and even read aloud Easter eggs from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

##### 

##### About The Project

This project serves as a dynamic, real-time encyclopedia for MCU secrets. Instead of relying on a static list, it queries the Gemini API to generate details for any character, movie, or keyword a user provides. It's a demonstration of how to build a secure, modern web app with a powerful AI backend.
